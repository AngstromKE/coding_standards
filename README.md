# Introduction
This document contains the guidelines and best practices for our team at AngstromLtd. This document is not a series of explanations as to how front-end technologies work. A basic familiarity with them is however assumed. The intent is not to be overly legalistic, but rather to give a solid set of guidelines to which developers are expected to adhere.

By maintaining consistency in coding styles and conventions, we can ease the burden of legacy code maintenance, and mitigate risk of breakage in the future. By adhering to best practices, we ensure optimized page loading and performance.

 The guidelines in this document cover the appropriate usage of standards compliant HTML, CSS, and JavaScript - as advocated by the World Wide Web Consortium and the Web Standards Project, the governing bodies of best practices on the web.
